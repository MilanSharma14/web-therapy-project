        <h2>Why Mental Health Matters</h2>
        <p>Mental health is as important as physical health. It affects how we think, feel, and act. Being mentally healthy helps us handle stress, relate to others, and make choices. It's essential for every stage of life, from childhood through adulthood.</p>
        
        <h2>Break the Stigma</h2>
        <p>Many people with mental health conditions hesitate to seek help due to stigma and discrimination. It's crucial to break the stigma surrounding mental illness and encourage open discussions about mental health.</p>
